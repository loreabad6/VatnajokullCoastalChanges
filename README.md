================

This repository is meant to host the spatio-temporal analysis of coastal
changes due to glacier and volcanic activity in the areas south of the
Vatnajokull ice cap. 

The analysis folder holds the code and some [notes](analysis/Notes.md) while the data
folder contains spatial data used in the analysis, mainly ancillary
